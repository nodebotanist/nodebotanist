# 1\) Nodebotanist's Rules for Being a Maker

I try to live by a few axioms that really help me; they're not meant to be a hard-line stance on my part unto you, take from them what you will. I find that they generally get me by with the minimum amount of stress and the most efficient and beneficial rewards. They also tend to help make interactions with others easier, and are aimed at making the world a better place,

## 1\) Information Should be Free

This applies to code and hardware-- I dare not venture into the quagmire that is other subjects in such broad strokes. But when it comes to software and hardware, I've found benefit in the freedom of information-- both for myself personally and the community at large.

I would, I guess, venture slightly further and say that communities should be transparent as possible-- especially those with that most important task of guiding open source projects.

## 2\) Do No Harm

I generally try to stick to this in general, and it should be pretty self-explanatory.

## 3\) You will fuck it up. Know when and how to apologize.

Again, a general rule of thumb for me in all things; our lizard brains love to get defensive when confronted with our mistakes. The best thing you can do for yourself and for your community is learn to supress that defensivness and learn to apologize. It's not weakness to be wrong and apologize.

## 4\) That being said, apologies are nothing without effort and improvement.

If you mess up the same way over and over, with the same apology, you're not doing yourself any favors. You're also hindering yourself if you don't try, at least regularly, not to be an asshole. Put some effort into your crft and behavior, and learn from those mistakes.

## 5\) Code is easy, hardware is easy, in comparison to people, which are hard.

On that same chord: code is replacable, hardware replacable, people? Not so much. We waste far too much time in the tech community worrying about software and hardware when we could get much more done by worrying about people even a fraction of the time. The potential we lose in exclusion affects the speed at which we innavate in pernicious and horrifying ways.

## 6\) If you're comfortable, you need to push harder.

When I get comfortable in my making skills, I get a metaphorical itch. What new technique did I miss while my head was down at my bench? Where am I getting away with being lazy on my projects? Push yourself to the brink of "I'm not smart enough" as often as you can-- you will surprise yourself.

## 7\) Know when to Rest

As someone with shaky health, I add this rule as a dire warning and a sign to not follow my paths. Know when to sleep, to take break or a walk. Learn your habits and build or break them as necessary.

## 8\) Write Everything Down

You'll forget things over time, and it will bite you. There will be a section on this because it's that important. Keep a notebook, hell, keep several-- keep links in lists, capture data when you find it, and try to keep it organized.

## 9\) Teach, and Learn

These go hand in hand, and are essential to not only the community, but to your own path forward. You may think you're not up for teaching, but there are many ways to teach-- there is the classical teaching a class, sure, but writing blog posts, offering advice, being a mentor, or anything that spreads information is teaching.

## 10\) Don't be an asshole. There's nothing wrong with being nice.

And, and I'm sad I feel I have to write this in 2017, don't be a fucking Nazi.
