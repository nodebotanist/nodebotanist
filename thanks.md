## Thanks

To my parents, Kelly and Joe, for always beleiving in and supporting me.

To Ray. You'll always be my mentor, and my friend, no matter how many times you roll your eyes when I add you to these things.

To Kevin -- you've put up with my erratic sleep schedule, typing away while you're fast asleep, and still manage to tell me I'm smart with a straight face. I love you.
