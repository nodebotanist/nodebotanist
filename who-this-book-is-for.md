## Who this Book is For

This is for the makers yet to emerge as much as it is for the ones who are stuck, or even the ones doing just fine, thanks. It's for folks who want to wander into the path of IoT with Node, or just see the path I've both been led down and forged for myself.

If you've ever seen an Arduino or other hardware project and thought "I would love to know enough to do that!" then this is most certainly aimed at you.

This book will be mostly about getting you started on your own path to being a resourceful and studious Maker; I hope to arm you with the skills to blaze your own path forward from there.

This book isn't for bigots, nazis, or assholes.
