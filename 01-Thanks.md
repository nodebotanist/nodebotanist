# Preface

I swore up and down I'd never write another book again. I guess I should've said I'll never write a book for a publisher again.

Knowledge should be free, after all, and while I'm in no position to say this, I'm not doing this to make money or glory. The only reason I'm calling it the Nodebotanist's Handbook is because its topic is broader than NodeBots, and I couldn't think of a better title that hadn't already been taken by a better writer.

This may coalesce into a book someday, it may rot in my GitHub with so many of my other endeavors. Only time will tell, really.

This book will be written in my prsonal voice, save for the parts where it isn't written by me, should that ever arise. I curse, I use a lot a metaphors, and I don't try to craft too strong a narrative if I find it superfluous.

## Thanks

To my parents, Kelly and Joe, for always beleiving in and supporting me.

To Ray. You'll always be my mentor, and my friend, no matter how many times you roll your eyes when I add you to these things.

To Kevin -- you've put up with my erratic sleep schedule, typing away while you're fast asleep, and still manage to tell me I'm smart with a straight face.

## Who this is for

This is for the makers yet te emerge as much as it is for the ones who are stuck, or even the ones doing just fine, thanks. It's for folks who want to wander into the path of IoT with Node, or just see the path I've both been led down and forged for myself.

If you've ever seen an Arduino, or other hardware project and thought "I would love to know enough to do that!" then this is most certainly aimed at you.

This book will be mostly about getting you started on your own path to building NodeBots; I hope to arm you with the skills to blaze your own path forward from there.

This book isn't for bigots, nazis, and assholes.
