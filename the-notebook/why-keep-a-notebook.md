## Why Keep a Notebook?

Well, for one, unless you plan on keeping everything in your head forever, you're going to forget things. And those things you forget will come back to bite you, sometimes lightly, sometimes not so. Sometimes it's just a few wasted seconds re-finding a wiring diagram; sometimes it's days of searching for that one thing you did to make the damn thing boot.

For another, there's the people who follow. We're never getting anywhere quickly if we spend our tiny human lifetimes trying to solve the same problems. There's also times where one person's unfinished experiment holds the breakthrough for someone else's project \(maybe even for the same person!\) Keeping notes and information around benefits everyone, even if the upkeep can be a bit of a pain in the ass.
