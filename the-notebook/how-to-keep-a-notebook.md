## How to Keep a Notebook

I'm not going to be very prescriptive here-- Just use systems that work for you.

I say systems because you're hopefully going to be holding onto lots of types of data, and there is no one perfect system for storing it all.

For example, I'll give an overview of my personal systems:

* GitBook: Logs, Links, anything written that isn't essentially code
* GitHub: I tend to keep a repository for a category of interest \(A board, an engine, a sensor\) and load my experimental code into it for safe storage and easy searching.
* OneNote: Private thoughts, things I want to write by hand or draw.
* Pinterest: Inspiration

If I had to offer some tips as to what systems you should use to store your data, I'd say it should be easy to backup, easy to search, and easy to access in less than ideal conditions \(no wifi, for instance\).
